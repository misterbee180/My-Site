				I am sick. I have been sick for the last 3 days and it is simply the worst. I have tried to sleep it off as much as I can but after a while I just cannot sleep any more. Plus, I think my bed sucks. I think this because when I sleep on it for a long time my back aches. Like really bad. I don't think beds are supposed to do that. But have you seen the price of beds these days. I will die before I spend money like that out of discomfort. <br><br>Tell you what though, right now I would love to buy a bed if it'd be delivered and put together without me lifting a muscle. <br><br>So I made the site derive its content from a php connection to a mysql database. It's pretty slick. Now I could do one of two things, either design some php functions to parse the data of this and adjust the info as necessary for the web OR I could just convert over to a blogging website. I'll see how I'm feeling next time I do this.<br><br>Keep working hard everyone! You never know when you wont be able to</p>

				This is what I'm saying. It's 11:51 and only now I think well shoots, maybe I should do that thing that I was supposed to do. So hey, heck with checking the spelling or consistancy of the topic I choose to write about because I had better things to do like play about 4 games of warcraft III, losing 3 of them. NE is so IMBA! Or how about watching 2 games of warcraft III match commentary. Yeah that's a good idea. Shoots, I don't need to bother covering the food that I cooked tonight that's been sitting on the stove for about 4 hours. Yeah, it'll be fine tomorrow.<br><br> That's one of those things about me that I hate. I hate how I can be a slave to my desires. I never have a schedule. I can't, because the moment something better comes up I want to be able to just drop what I'm doing and do it. Even if it's not better. Even if its just mildly more entertaining than the current task. I have been known to willingly wash my dishes if it meant not having to do something less appealing.<br><br> I'm supposed to know better because I'm grown up. I'm supposed to be an adult. It's so hard though, and it's nights like these where I realize how far from it I really am.<br><br> Anyway, rant aside, I hope you all enjoyed the 60 degree weather today! It was amazing! I went running which was nice and didn't feel the burning feeling you get in your lungs when you run and breath in cold air. My doctor called it lung cancer. We had a good laugh. But then he wouldn't let the joke pass so I stopped seeing him. Some people just don't know when to quit, am I right!<br><br> Peaces! </p>

					This is kinda funny because it looks to you like I'm doing well and keeping up with
					populating this site with content but the irony is that I've managed to do 3 days
					worth of content in less than 24 hours. You might be quick to thinking that doesn't
					make any sense. Well it does because I did my first post at like 1:00 yesterday, did
					my second post yesterday as well, and did my third post tonight at 12:30. So anyways,
					I found something new out so I figured I'd post it. You'll see if you look closely
					that the side isn't just a single color any more. That's because I combined a background
					image with a background color. I created a tile using a hounds tooth patern I found
					online. 81 by 88... I don't know how this makes a pattern that matches but it does.
					I then removed the black color to become empty space and then colored over the white
					with the color I wanted to go with the current background color. Combinding the tiled
					image with the background color creates the effect you see here.
					<br><br>
					It's also worth nothing what I'm starting to realize about image types:
					<ul><li>Jpg - a simple and small image format</li>
						<li>Gif - another small image format that allows for empty space</li>
						<li>Png - a larger image format that allows for empty space and alpha color levels</li>
						<li>Gimp - an image program that sucks</li>
					</ul>
					Anyways, I'm getting tired so it's time to head to bed. Catch ya all later!
					<br><br>
					Addition: So one thing that I think is really smart in general is to have something
					constructive that can take up some of your free time. I am not talking about videogames.
					Videogames are fun, but in the end, unless you're planning on training to do it for a
					living, it's not progressive. But so many things are. I for instance have taking up a
					few different things including building a website. It is not very hard but theres work
					that needs to be put into understanding how everything works. And there's a lot that can
					be learned. For instance I've learned css and html pretty well. I mean there's always more
					that I can learn but I am getting it. I am also starting to use apostophies less because
					then I have to paste the symbol in which I think notepad ++ makes it easier to do but not
					easy. Anyway, there is also php which I can learn so that I can connect my page to a database
					and then autogenerate all of these stupid divs. I can also use it for calculations on the
					server side which is really important if my site is doing computations which would be too
					intensive for the user computers. I could also learn jquery and bootstrap better... or at all.
					In general there's a ton of learning that I can do and it can be really helpful mentally
					especially if there are other things on your mind. <br><br>
					This however is a subject for another day. Maybe tomorrow I will talk about my revelations in
					regards job hunting and also why sites like blogger or wordpress are great! We'll see.
					<br><br>Peaces!</p>

					This is day 2 of posting here. It's more just to see how the layout of this page
					will change as more content is added. I think it'll be okay. I have had trouble 
					in the past keeping things like this up to date. It's weird though when you think
					about it because it's not hard. Something like this is synonomous with doing the
					dishes. If you do about 5 minutes of dishes a day you won't have to worry about
					there every being so much that it becomes a chore. Plus your house will always look
					up to a certain standard. Same with this. If I just devoted 5 minutes of my day to
					jotting down my thoughts here I would have a content filled page in no time. Will
					the content be good? Eh... maybe... but at the very least, it will be original.
					<br><br>
					Here are a few things I learned:<br>
					<ul><li>Padding includes content while margin just creates space. When applicable
					it's safer to use a container div and have that div contain padding that you want
					as an insides div's margins to be. Then you can get rid of the margins on the inside
					div.</li></ul>
					So anyways, stay classy everyone. Catch you guys tomorrow.</p>

					Hey all, it's Mick. Just figured I'd start this off with just a simple post 
					about what this site's intended purpose is. It's a way to show myself that I
					can learn anything really really easily if I just devote the same amount of time 
					to it that I would if I would just get a job and learn it there. Why limit myself
					to what an employeer wants me to do? Why not limit myself to what ever I think
					is a good idea? Why not make your good ideas and then either learn they actually 
					are good ideas or learn what a good idea is not. Well here's to hoping. I actually 
					created this site really quickly this time which is a surprise.<br><br>
					Here are a few things I learned:<br>
					<ul><li>To center a div set margins on the div to 0 auto;</li>
					<li>Many pages exist on the web specifically to give you the css you need for random things like shadows or colors</li>
					<li>Notepad++ is awesome and the fact that I still use notepad at work is crazy</li>
					<li>Some games just take one or two chances to get into</li></ul>

					I guess that's a good enough post for now. Catch ya'll later. Mick. Finish this!</p>
